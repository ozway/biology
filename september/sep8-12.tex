\begin{enumerate}
\item NSE Model

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Progress/Notes}

\subsubsection{NSE Model -- run using workflow.sh}
These are the changes I've made to cubfits/misc to try and run the NSE model. (run\_nsef.r is just a copied version of run\_roc.r with the following exceptions)
\begin{itemize}
\item In run\_nsef.r, changed model=``roc" to model=``nsef" in cubsinglechain and cubmultichain for both "cubfits" and "cubappr"
\item In run\_nsef.r, added .CF.CT\$model $<$- "nsef"; before each each call of cubsinglechain and cubmultichain
\item In run\_utility.r, changed get.logL $<$- function(ret, data, model="roc") to get.logL $<$- function(ret, data, model="nsef")
\item Changed workflow.r from 
\begin{itemize}
\item Rscript run\_roc.r -c \$cubmethod -s "0.5 1 2 4" -f \$genome -p \$empphi -o \$folder -n \$foutname -i \$pinit $>>$ \$logfile \& 

to

\item Rscript run\_nsef.r -c \$cubmethod -s "0.5 1 2 4" -f \$genome -p \$empphi -o \$folder -n \$foutname -i \$pinit $>>$ \$logfile \&
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

I also changed to cubsinglechain instead of cubmultichain, to try and simplify matters, but then the MCMC started throwing "acceptance out of range" at every step of the iteration. Started at 10:44, ran until 11:44. 

I'll retry with cubmultichain. I had run a multichain version on 9/5, and it just stalled. However, I just added run\_utility.r change

Latest settings that worked!
\\n.samples = 10  
\\use.n.samples = 10
\\n.chains = 4
\\n.cores = 4
\\min.samples=50
\\max.samples=100

\verbatiminput{data/sep8.nse.100samples.log}


I was able to repeat these results using 1000 samples, (minimum of 500 samples), though it stopped after 500 samples. The Gelman score was 1.10581040617552. For brevity, the 500 sample log is not included in this pdf, but it is in the github.


\subsubsection{Larger NSE Model}

Ran from 17:22 to 19:12, then ended with no error messages. "Timing stopped at"

Is it possible that the model is OVERconverging? I had it doing 500 samples between checks, and it should succeed at doing 500 samples...


\subsubsection{NSE Model -- debug}

Ran the contents of cubfits/demo/nsef.train.r in an R interactive session, adding in the line debugonce(cubfits)

As far as I can tell, the cubfits() function itself doesn't actually use the model or .CF.CT\$model, I'll need ot look at drawP and drawPhi.

According to Cedric, it's worthwhile to look at cubfits/cubfits/R/my.logdmultinomCodOne.r. That function calls cubfits/cubfits/src/stable\_exp.c and cubfits/cubfits/src/lib.c.


\subsubsection{Optimal/Pessimal Code}

Cedric made the change that had been discussed, where we switch from $\Delta t$ values to $\Delta\eta$

In making that change, I also made several more changes.

\begin{itemize}
\item fixed a bug where the default codon for Q was wrong
\item Changed from analyzing $\Delta t$ to $\Delta\eta$ values. Made a mock up etaValues.bmat for example by just inverting the signs of the values
\item made the language more clear for "optimal/best" versus "minimum/maximum"
\item added a count and ratio for how many codons are actually being up/downgraded
\end{itemize}

Deepika contacted me about an error in the code. The beginning of the for loop (line 78 in the original, now line 79)

for(index in 1:length(sequence[[gene]]/3))\{
\\to

for(index in 1:(length(sequence[[gene]])/3))\{

~

The first one was causing a fractional value of index, which was making it do weird things, but mainly, it was making the code replace random chunks of genome, rather than accurately dividing the codon into groups of 3.


\subsubsection{First Order Approximations}

For completeness, I also wrote down how we derived the fitness function in fitnessHistory.tex


$p_{ic}$ is the probability of a nonsense error at position $i$ using codon $c$
\\ $p_j$ is the probability of a nonsense error at position $j$

~

First order approximation about $p_{ic} = 0$ is
$$f(p_{ic} \approx f(0) + f'(0)*(p_{ic}-0)
= p_{ic}\left(
\left[\sum_{k=1}^{i} a_1 + a_2(k-1)\right]
\left[\prod_{j=i+1}^{n}(\frac{1}{1-p_{j}})\right]
\right)
$$


First order approximation about $p_{i+1} \approx p_{i+2} \cdots \approx p_{n} \approx 0$ is

$$
f(p_j) \approx
\left[\sum_{k=1}^{i} a_1 + a_2(k-1)\right]
\left[\frac{p_{ic}}{1-p_{ic}}\right]
+
\left( (i+1) - n \right)
\left[\sum_{k=1}^{i} a_1 + a_2(k-1)\right]
\left[\frac{p_{ic}}{1-p_{ic}}\right]
\left( p_{j} \right)
$$

$$
f(p_j) \approx
f(0) + (f(0))(p_j)((i+1)-n)
$$


Details are in approx.tex


\subsubsection{Simulated Data Set from REU13}
The data is in /home/lbrown/reucode/data/inputsimdata/REU\_data

I think elongation rate refers to the odds $\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$.



\subsection{Goals for next Week}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulated Data Set
\item Potentially look at the c files in cubfits/cubfits/src
\item \sout{Code the first order approximations? Looking at my draw*.r for the fitness function}
\item Check for problems in Wei-Chen's NSE code, specifically
\begin{enumerate}
\item \sout{Unnecessary VGLM calls leading to longer run times} As far as I can tell, my.fitMultinomOne.nsef and my.fitMultinomOne.roc are using the same amount of vglm calls.
\item Ending crash caused by running out of memory
\end{enumerate}

\item Continue to improve the optimal-pessimal code as Deepika works with it.
\end{enumerate}
