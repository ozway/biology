\section{Week of September 22nd-26th}
\subsection{Goals for the Week}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write out the math from 9/19 (from the green notebook)
\item Get observed yeast phi values from REU data
\item Run NSE model with the Browser line when $phi$ is proposed to see what is causing NaN
\item Ideally, an NSE patch to fix it (try NaN to NA?)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Progress/Notes}

\subsubsection{Write out the math from 9/19 (from the green notebook)}

see genomeProb.tex and genomeProb.pdf

\subsubsection{Get observed yeast phi values from REU data}

\subsubsection{Run NSE model with the Browser line when $phi$ is proposed to see what is causing NaN}

7/22: The local library has been built. I removed the \& to ensure that browser() will activate, and and wrote in two checks in my.logdmultinomCodOne.r

\verbatiminput{misc/browsercommand.txt}

but it's taken nearly 8 hours to run!!! The run started at: 2014-09-22 10:24:55 

I left at 18:15:, so I don't know what happens.

\subsubsection{Ideally, an NSE patch to fix it (try NaN to NA?)}
