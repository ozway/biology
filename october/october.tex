\section{Goals for the Month}
%Paste output from writeGoals
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find out what causes some of the probabilties to go outrageously high
\item Use the Simulated Yeast Genome, compare to the Ecoli genome
\item If possible, NSE Patch
\item Debugging Thoughts
\end{enumerate}

\section{Progress/Notes}

\subsection{Find out what causes some of the probabilties to go outrageously high}

\subsubsection{Compare Differences in the Code}

Codes where NSE and ROC are the same:
\begin{enumerate}
\item my.estimatePhiOne

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Look at stddev(phi)}

I have a run going that is tracking the scales of the MCMC for the phi values.

Since the scale of the MCMC should be about the Standard Devation of Phi, we'll see what happens.

PROBLEM:
The ROC model has different Phi scales for each gene. The NSE model keeps all the scales the same between different genes. That could be contributing to the problem?

\subsection{Simulated Yeast Genome}

\subsubsection{Use Sections of the Simulated Yeast Genome}
I ran one 5th of the yeast genome(section1.fasta, section1.csv) and it FINISHED. but... not well.

See the results in data/10.01.yeastnse.*

\begin{itemize}
\item It took just over 30 hours to finish\\
started at: 2014-10-01 15:57:54\\
finished at: 2014-10-02 22:08:56 

\item The proposed phi values are still outrageously too high. The final proposed phi had mean value 2766786.09545948

\item Still proposing some 0 (-Inf) values for lpProp. At most, around 45-49 Inf per run.

\item Xobs (the original phi values) are generally much lower than the results of run

\item The values are not very accurate.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Crashed Yeast Run}

The vast vast majority of the phi values being proposed are fine. -Inf values are throwing it off. 


\subsection{E. Coli genome}

A LARGE NSE RUN OF THE E. COLI GENOME RAN TO COMPLETION.



\subsection{If possible, NSE Patch}
