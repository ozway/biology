\section{Progress/Notes}

\subsection{Generate new genomes}

1/5: Fixed a small bug in the genome code.

Now that the code actually updates the codons, not just the codon index, we can generate new genomes.

\subsubsection{Potential Error -- Reading small chunks of the script as commands?}

I've seen this type of error before, and I'm still confused by it.

\begin{verbatim}
lbrown@gauley:~/cubfits/preston$ tail test*
==> test.ModOutput <==
	Simulating YPR194C . . .
	Simulating YPR196W . . .
	Simulating YPR198W . . .
	Simulating YPR199C . . .
	Simulating YPR200C . . .
	Simulating YPR201W . . .
	Simulating YPR202W . . .
	Simulating YPR203W . . .
Error: unexpected ')' in "x.simulation.type = 'M')"
Execution halted

==> test.output <==
	Simulating YPR194C . . .
	Simulating YPR196W . . .
	Simulating YPR198W . . .
	Simulating YPR199C . . .
	Simulating YPR200C . . .

	Simulating YPR202W . . .
	Simulating YPR203W . . .
Error: unexpected ')' in "sta)"
Execution halted
\end{verbatim}

This is quite confusing. There are no problems in those lines, and the commands the error indicates don't... exist?

My best judgement is that the first error is the tail chunk of
\begin{verbatim}
sim.genome <- simulate.data.all.genes(parallel='lapply', obs.genome = obs.genome, obs.phi = phi$obs, obs.codon.parms = codon.params$obs, obs.genome.parms = obs.genome.parms, BIS=4, GMT=0, MES=0, n.cores=4, aux.simulation.type = 'M')
\end{verbatim}

And the code is just trying to execute x.simulation.type = 'M') as a standalone command, which does produce the shown error. Similarly, for the second error, I think it's using the tail end of

\begin{verbatim}
write.fasta(sequences = sim.seqs, names = seq.ids, file.out = out.fasta)
\end{verbatim}

And just running sta) as a command, which produces the shown error.

Google doesn't seem to show other people having this error. Is it just a problem with Rscript? RAM running out? (Doubtful, Gauley is powerful). Perhaps a problem with lapply/mclapply? One of the processes finishes early, and this... breaks the R interpreter?


\subsection{Speed up NSE model}

\subsubsection{Move log into C?}

Right now, the code exponentiates the values in the C code (to be normalized), then later, in the R code, calulates the logarithm of those values, to correct this. Since C code is generally faster than R code, I thought it may be worthwhile to move that calculation into the C code.

I ran a quick test case (the code can be found in data/cLogTest.tar.gz), and it seems like making that change would save about 10 nanoseconds per gene. Our simulated yeast has 2.8 million genes, so it's only about a .3 second improvement per MCMC proposal. Basically, this change is too minor.

\subsection{Move to Newton}
